## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project aims to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using anonymized data. It tackles the class imbalance problem using oversampling techniques like **SMOTE** and combines multiple models in an ensemble for better accuracy.

Key Features:
- Advanced classification techniques (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Voting Classifier)
- Imbalanced data handling (SMOTE)
- Modular codebase with MLflow integration
- Streamlit web app for real-time prediction
